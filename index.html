           <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
           <p>
            <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR</b> was an Indian aerospace scientist 
            and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. 
            Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram,  Tamil Nadu, he studied
             physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a
              scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and 
              Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) 
              and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military 
              missile development efforts.[2] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man 
              of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch 
              vehicle technology.[3][4][5] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, 
              and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998,  the first since 
              the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
